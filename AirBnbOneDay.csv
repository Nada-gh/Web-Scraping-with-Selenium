Response from A:
I'm very disappointed to read this. But after being a host for four years I'm not surprised. This person was desperately looking for things to complain about. They even uninstalled my showerhead and complained about that! The claim of the bed being too small is ridiculous, it is a standard full-sized double bed. It's just sad to see how some people go through so much trouble to scam the system in order to get a cheaper stay, it's even sadder that it was done during the holidays. But either way, we will continue to provide our apartments and good service to people who want an affordable alternative to hotels in NYC.

Communication skills need to stronger , send up to date documents to the guest so that everyone is on the same page, improve customer service overall
Response from Izabel:
Lorraine came with her friend. We had some issues with their check in. She informed us that they want to drop off their bags at 7am to which we agreed, normal check in was 4-7pm. They were taking the bus from Montreal to NY. They also asked that they want to 'freshen up' after the long trip - we said that if the bathroom is available, they can but not for long because current guests have priority to use the bathroom. She texted us through the night 2am and 6am, informing us that they will be late. 7am, no update even after we texted them. Then they just showed up around 830am and told us that we did not respond, apparently expecting us to reply in the middle of the night. We texted them around 7am to which they did not reply even though they said they will inform us when they reach the bus station. The bathroom was occupied when they arrived as normal in the morning and we told them they had to wait. We had to tell them to limit their time in the bathroom to maximum 5 minutes as they wanted to use it for longer. It seemed that they were not appreciative that we accommodated their early arrival nor were they considerate of our current guests. We gave them the key to the front door so they can come back later to check in, they said 4 pm. But they showed up at 2pm without notifying us. It would have been common courtesy to do so. As it happened, we were home and the room was ready so they were able to check in their room 2 hours early. We feel these guests are inconsiderate and that they are entitled to their own wants without respect of house rules and other guests.

Response from Robin:
Amalia's review is unfortunately not accurate as there is a supermarket called Extra 3 blocks away as well as a Dunken Donuts and McDonald's which serves coffee. There is another supermarket called Bravo also within walking distance. I am not sure why she would write this clearly misinformation. Amalia never mentioned anything about the noise. If there is an issue with cleanliness or noise please do say something so it can be addressed. We want everyone to have the best experience possible. Amalia wanted to use the kitchen which is fine but I don't expect to see it as part of the review private or public as its not listed as an amenity. In her private comments it was among her complaints. We use it as a place for storage etc..

Close to the public transport, very easy access to New York downtown. Easy to communicate with Robin, she is a good host. The bed was clean but the room itself was not. It is ok if you need a functional accomodation for a few days on reasoneable price.

We have a cleaner that comes daily. Janos never said there were any issues. We would have been happy to do anything to meet his standards.

Amazing little space in the heart of Chelsea. About a 5 minute walk to the subway and food. The neighbour shares the bathroom was rarely there so no problem with sharing the space. Check in was super easy and Liad is a great host!

Response from Capri:
Hello, I provided an extra blanket (lightweight) - apologies if this didn't help. I did see the new blanket that you left for the next guest, thank you but you didn't have to leave it! :) The cigarettes, ughh!! I clearly stated NO smoking indoors. Had I known, I would have taken care of this issue ASAP. I don't smoke nor do I allow any smoking inside of the house! I'm very sorry for this! As for the heat, yes, there is clanking because of the radiator heating system. I'm sorry but I can't change the heat to stop clanking if it's turned on but if it's off, then everyone will freeze, especially in the cold weather. I do thank you for staying, you guys were great and I would welcome you back, anytime! =)

Response from LaTorre Fratelli:
Thanks for the feedback! I want to sincerely apologize you got a parking ticket. We do give our guests specific parking instructions and advice, which included to watch the street cleaning times if you park on the street. We do also suggest a parking garage less than a quarter mile away that charges about $10 a day. You can also reserve a spot in the lot online so you can come anytime. We never have issues finding street parking out front of the building though. The neighborhood is perfectly safe. It is definitely cultural diverse, but mostly consists of families and young professionals. We've been living in the area for years and never had any issues whatsoever. The walk to the path is wel lit and populated. The area is progressing rapidly and there are lots of new developments around the area due to the close proximity of the path. Thanks!

Great host, the only problem is the absence of a kitchen. Otherwise it is great.
Response from Leah:
Thank you but I am disappointed with the 2 stars for value and the overall 4 stars which is viewed as negative by Airbnb. During your stay, you paid $31 per night. Next time, please use the filters so that you find all of the great places in Brooklyn, NY with a kitchen plus the other amenities I offer including wifi, iron, self check-in, shampoo, hair dryer, near the 2 and 5 trains in a safe neighborhood with cable/HBO & Showtime at $31 in Brooklyn, NY. I found 2 such places (one in a bad neighborhood and the other far off in the boon docks of Brooklyn). I strongly suggest you use the filters to view other options so that you will be happy rather than giving poor ratings. I want my guests to be happy and know, with confidence, that they have found one of the most inexpensive places in Brooklyn because I work extremely hard to add value where possible since I do not offer a kitchen to my guests.

Nice location and neat room but was kind a weird as there were instructions written all over the wall. Also, guests are instructed to clean the room with the broom during checkout inspite of charging 10$ cleaning charges through AirBNB, which is kind of unfair.
Response from Amardeep:
Good Morning Prashanth. thanks for coming at our house. thanks for positive and honest reviews. 1 writing notes on the wall gets fully noticed by the guest. right where we want them to see. 2.guests are advised to clean the room for their own benefit. so they can see if they have left any thing behind. people leave their phone charger, socks and etc etc in the room by mistake. tell them to give a final look before they leave is to their benefit. 3. 10 usd charges for cleaning is the room cleaning fee when they arrive. room is being sanitized. sheets and changed, desk is wiped, a clean towel is handed to the guests. i am sure you got all this done in your room when you arrived at the facility. sorry to say some people treat airbnb rooms like a hotel room. they would leave the wet towel on the bed. or trash in the room . food containers and plastic bottles are all left in the room. I am sure no airbnb host would like to sweep like a servant . we rent it to the educated people . we expect them to throw out their trash in the cans. we advise them to act like a responsible adult and take care of your stuff. it is not easy to maintain a clean house. and get 5 stars all the time i am sure you can change your opinion about us and will change your reviews to 5 stars. Haha. thanks any way we do give weekly and monthly discounts, let us know when will you be back Rita and Family

Response from Giraud:
Compared to most streets in the neighborhood which is indeed known for the night life, I think it's relatively quiet because it's shielded by two large schools that normally don't have anything going at night. The noise experienced may have been due to timing because it was Halloween- there may have been some seasonal events going on nearby. It's otherwise surprisingly and relatively quiet for typical NYC given how close you are to bars, restaurants, etc.

It is a lousy apartment, the furnitures were broken and not clean, especially the bed clothes was dirty. Close to subway, and quick answer from Pam and Alex, who we never met. We can definitely not recommend this apartment. Regards from Helle & Flemming

Response from Clifford:
I'm sorry to hear that there were some issues with your stay. Thank you for the feedback, as I'm always striving to be better. A few things to note: Usually I make sure to clean the bathroom regularly, but I had just returned from a business trip when Anastasia arrived (and there had been a previous guest staying), so I wasn't able to clean the bathroom until the next day. I will do better with that in the future. As far as street noise, I had recently installed the window air conditioner which does let in some additional noise (the window AC is not installed in the winter). That said, there have been several guests after Anastasia who have said the room is very quiet, so I suppose it just depends on perspective. In my experience living in a number of NYC apartments, it is much quieter than most, even with the AC in. Also, I believe the noise level could have had something to do with the window AC not being turned on because we ended up having cooler weather during Anastasia's stay. When the AC is on, noise from outside harder to hear. As far as communication goes, unfortunately due to how much I work, I sometimes have more or less time to show guests around. I have a thorough email that all guest receive before their arrival. I also want to note that there is a guide book in the bedroom that I have prepared with a lot of information about the apartment and the neighborhood. Towels are in the hallway closet (there is a sign on the closet door).

So, we went to Tiffany's place for 4 nights. All in all, it was okay for the price we paid, but I would not return nor recommend that place to my friends unfortunately. PROS: - Location. It is a 10 minutes walk from subway and from there it is really easy to get to Manhattan…Read more

Response from Tiffany:
Please note that I do have a roommate. Always happy to accommodate an early arrival outside of my regular check-in time window (as I did here), but in such a case, my roommate will in fact be the one to open the door. If the idea of being checked in by someone who is not me does not sit well with you, please be sure to plan your arrival within the check-in window stated on the listing. As always, happy to accommodate an earlier arrival but as hosting is not my 24/7 job, I will not be readily available 24/7 to suit your arrival.

The place was easy to locate. The area was great! Quiet but close to amenities. Tiffany was flexible enough to let me check early so that helped a lot. The neighbors were a little loud but over all it was a great stay. I would definitely stay again. Thanks Tiffany!

So the add never said we provided free parking and airbnb customer service explained this to you. You rented a sleeper sofa for 5 days in Jersey City and you wanted free parking come on a $100.00 dollar stay.

Privacy was excellent! Quick responses from the host Gerry .....Wasn' t a fan of the neighbourhood. ..
Stephanie
February 2019
The bed is very comfortable. TV and towel come with the room. Gerry, answers promptly and is very kind. I recommended staying here for a couple of days. The neighborhood can be somewhat sketchy but if you are only staying there to sleep and not walk around then you’re fine!
Response from Gerry:
Thanks for the feedback but I do have to respond about the comment on the neighborhood: I have lived safely there for 10 years and have never felt unsafe and neither did my previous guests. Ms. Stephanie mentioned an Uber incident that made her uncomfortable that I have possibly no control over. It is a minority and working class neighborhood but nowhere unsafe or sketchy. While this might not be Park slope or upper east side, any non-prejudiced guest can expect a safe and heavily discounted typical Brooklyn experience.

Thanks for the kind words about our space, and I’m sorry you felt unsafe in the neighborhood. Bed-Stuy is an up and coming, predominantly African American neighborhood with tree-lined blocks of residential buildings. None of our other guests have expressed any concerns over their safety, and we’ve always felt very comfortable in our home.

I stay fairly often in NYC for work, and I keep coming back to S's place. It is comfortable, spacious, clean, convenient for public transportation, and reasonably priced, and S is an excellent host. Not really much more to say---the fact that I keep coming back should say it all.

Response from Isabella:
Joanie, As we've spoken about at length and based on timestamped photos from the cleaning company you are lying. You are a con artist. I do not wish to further this conflict as we have handled it offline, police almost had to get involved and my landlord is reconsidering letting me use airbnb after having you in the apartment. You broke into my roommate's room, you stole things from the apartment. You lied over and over again and as you know we have the messages back and forth and I was more than happy to help until I realized you were scamming me. Airbnb believed me based on all the proof and evidence and backed me up, hence why a refund was not provided to you. I hate that this happened, I wanted to believe you but the evidence against you was overwhelming. I wish you the best.

Loved the place. Very cute and It was much bigger than I anticipated. Some places get good reviews and are not that great but that is not the case here. Was fantastic and highly recommend. It takes 20-30 via transit to get to Times Square but it is great neighbourhood.

Response from Zen Home:
Hi Leonard, As clearly stated in our policy, we don't allow any type of parties to be allowed at our place. The place has strict occupancy guideline of 3 people as mentioned in Airbnb and the place was booked for only two people. The number of guests present in the apartment was definitely way more than 3 people and there was a house party going in the apartment. We rent our places strictly for residential purposes and these can't be used as party pad by guests. We apologize for the experience, but we received numerous complaints from building management regarding noise. We were left with no choice but to obtain copies of everyone visiting the apartment, without any knowledge to us. Please understand that this is residential building, where people stay with their kids and we are required to take steps to ensure safety of residents of the building. Again, we don't rent our properties for parties - house parties, extra number of guests, smoking in the apartment is strictly prohibited. It is very very clearly listed on our listings.

Response from Blair:
For $120-$150 a night - in NYC - honey please please please pay extra money and stay somewhere else. FUTURE RENTERS - Hello! Patricia had an reaction to a single cockroach in the summer, on a ground floor apt with a direct door to the outside - thus the Subjective review. Read on for further explanation. Otherwise, know that if you let me know that you are uncomfortable with something - I always handle it. See other reviews for proof. Case in point: the door was newly broken, Patricia failed to mention it to me until the review over a week later. I fixed it immediately bc that IS something that actually matters! And geez, don't you think, because it is a safety and liability thing for me in my personal home that you should have said something? FUTURE RENTERS - the ""mattress on the floor"" is the highest quality natural latex mattress set atop a platform that was designed specifically for that purpose - it is not a ""floor"" designed for any other use than sleeping. My cleaning gal did a full sweep of all the cabinets to check for opening and pest homes. She found nothing, which is on par with my experience for the last 5 years. Keep you space clean and you won't breed unwelcome visitors. BC it is ground floor you may get a passerby-er if you leave the doors open!

We suggest all our guests to READ the brutally honest description before booking which details how the bathroom is SHARED and cleaned once a day and NO common areas are available. We also encourage those who want a private bath, A LARGE room, professional staffed accommodations, or seek accommodations across from the Hudson River to NYC to please book elsewhere and pay the price of ($100 - $400 per night) to do so. We are a budget accommodation for guests who are seeking a family run home with commuter access to NYC. (host commutes to NYC every day for work). Good luck in your travels.

Está bien. La calefacción no funciona fuera de los dormitorios y el agua caliente se acaba más o menos rápido. En cualquier caso la relacion calidad/precio es razonable y las fotos representan la realidad. Se encuentra como 5-10 minutos del metro, eso está bastante bien.

Response from Jenny:
Guest, Zoulikha initially booked for 5 days and then she extended the same apartment twice for 8 days each. If she have had so many issues with apartment then she must not have booked. We believe her whole review is about luggage pickup. SHE did come to our office and met, same Indian guy. She was supposed to leave on Jan 20, and she did leave on Jan 20. We have had very clear instructions to leave the keys in the apartment. Instead she took one key to front desk at 10pm and asked front desk to keep the key. Front desk has very strict policy not to handle any keys at all. Front desk work for building management and not our company. But she started creating a scene with front desk person, and he was new. He got scared and kept one key. Now, at 11pm she calls our company phone ( BTW, the Indian guy with heavy accent is my husband) and my husband answers and she tells that she left for the airport. She left one key with front desk. Front desk agreed to help her company give the luggage to them.(front desk shift changes at 11pm and the same guy is not scheduled to work for another 48 hours). Yes, she did leave the apartment and country and left her luggage in our apartment. We never agreed to keep her luggage. If you are going to make such arrangements, guests first speak to us then we all agree on the process. But in this case, she sigle handedly decided on whole process and confirmed to herself that 1) . It is ok leave the luggage in the apartment beyond her checkout date, 2) it is ok not to take permission from our office whether it is ok or not. 3) assumed that front desk will be OK to keep the keys. (she decided to walk to front desk guy at time of check out and forced keys on him). Our company can't handle such arrangements. OK, then next day she was not reachable on cell, she called back after 72 hours and she become abusive that why can't we keep the luggage. Our next guest refused to checkin to the apartment because she left almost six bags including open boxes in plastic move in boxes. Airbnb was not able to reach her either. About us : I started with one furnished apartment few years back, we expanded our operations and my husband joined. We hired couple of people to help us and provide excellent customer service. It is not practical feasible for me to be there all the time and provide service. At this time, we host close to 4000 reservations in one year.Our office is always staffed from 9am to 8pm, just to provide on-site customer service. Guest could store their luggage free of cost in our office located in same building. We request you to please give us heads up and don't leave anything in apartment. We have guests who have stored their luggage for fees in our storage while they make trip to other parts of USA. But they have all been very nice to move their luggage into our office and they never left it in the apartment. Building maintenance do enter apartments to schedule regular maintenance. You can check all the reviews and there was never an incident where something happened. Also, our office ask every guest whether it is ok to enter the apartment in their absence. ******We request everyone to please read at other old and recent reviews. *********

Response from Anders:
Hi Anna Thank you for review Sorry about the noises you experienced. But yes this is the big old city,that’s what most of buildings here are,and the PRICE I offer should make up for it,otherwise it is double the price to stay around this area. And I understand for light sleepers outside big city it might be not comfortable,but I don’t notice things like that,I guess I am used to live in a big city

Response from Anchor Realty:
Hi all, let me tell you a little here myself. This guest had never visited New York before. Has no idea what a “good” or “bad” neighborhood is supposed to be like in New York. The tap water in New York is considered some **of the best in the country** so I think this guest has heard a wrong report about the tap water in this city. This is just basically a review based on not understanding what prices are like in New York. And having issues with the size of the place is just pretty strange considering it’s clearly stated in the ad, and clearly shows in the pictures and is not a surprise for a person who has looked before booking. The neighborhood is not bad and a person can be scared or not scared depending on what level of how worried a person is by nature. If this person has never visited this town before, they’ll have a shock of this stuff anywhere. And if this guest thought thar$25-35 is a lot of money for a bed in New York, and he should have received some Four Seasons in Upper East Side for this price then this is just a delusion that a lot of guest time tourists can have in New York. I value all reviews and it’s just pretty unfortunate when a guest leaves a review having no idea what they’re talking about

Nancy is a consummate host and an endlessly interesting person! I was in the middle of Spanish Harlem and enjoyed the opportunity to employ my embryonic Spanish. This is a real Harlem/New York experience!

The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
Response from Susan:
The guest made the reservation very early, when there was no pet in my house. In late June, we got pets in my house, and I informed the guest immediately about this change. I did not want to surprise the guest, and I did not want my guest to feel uncomfortable while staying here. So I communicated with the guest before the arrival date, and the guest agreed to cancel this reservation. And this reservation was canceled with full refund.

The place is highly recommended. The owner is professional and flexible when it comes to arrival and departure of guest. It’s near the train station and restaurants nearby are worth trying. Most of all it’s inexpensive, clean and neat.
Response from Viviana:

The property owner is responsive to messages and the neighborhood felt safe and quite. However, the heating system was broken so it might be a little cold during winter Otherwise, the bed was comfortable!

It's a little bit far from central manhattan but it is acceptable if you mainly visit brooklyn. My room was right next to the street so there was some noisy but there were many other room inside. Room was spacy.

Response from Brian:
Thank you for the positive words but the ratings I was given were not conducive to the service provided. Yes, there was a slight issue with your checkin but I feel that that was or should have been erased after I gave you a refund for an entire days stay. Plus you paid less than $150. for a four night stay in Brooklyn NY in an apartment that is equal to or even better than hotels costing significantly more. You can not say one thing and then give ratings that say another.

Beware of this listing. Very disappointing Airbnb experience. My boyfriend and I decided to stay at this apartment for 2 nights, after we saw the positive reviews and pictures. In reality, the level of cleanliness wasn't as the pictures make it seem. We arrived at the apartment…Read more
Response from BrooklynSleeps:
We are absolutely shocked at this feedback... we've hosted dozens of guests and have been rated an average of 4.5 stars, which is no trivial achievement. I would encourage visitors to read through our other reviews to get a more realistic perspective, and we are including our review of Emma below: Emma was quite polite in general, and our overall experience hosting Emma and her boyfriend was okay... but we kind of felt like the help rather than their hosts. Upon arrival, there was some unhappiness about a bit of lint on the bedsheets. We were very sorry about the sheets and remade the bed straight away. And then we heard that Emma saw some hairs in the bathroom, but only after both Emma and her boyfriend had freshened up and showered. We often board dogs at our apartment, and despite our best scrub sessions in the bathroom sometimes hairs find their way back into the guest bathroom. In the end, it didn't matter—we cleaned the bathroom a second time without question. On a different night of their stay, we were finishing up a movie when we heard Emma and her boyfriend come in for the night. We saw that they were beginning to prepare for sleep, so we made sure the volume was at a very modest level. Even still, Emma complained that the sound was too loud. We of course reduced the volume more, even if it meant that subtitles were necessary. All in all, we think perhaps Emma was expecting more of a hotel experience, or even to have a space not shared by the hosts.

the place is not bad. It does get a little loud at times as the other rooms seem to be very close together and the walls are thin. The towels smelled bad so you may want to bring some. For the price it's not bad but it should only be a place to sleep and the location is good.

The guest just give me a feedback that I have to clean the room often. The thing is that he stays for a week with a budget long term rate around $33 a night in convenient and good neighborhood. cleaning fee charged $5. It makes sense if he could tell me earlier. He will pay more to stay at hotel if he requires more cleaning.

The private room/bath in Muhmmad's apartment was neat, clean and nicely sized. Muhammad was easy to communicate with prior and during stay. The only downside was the noise level. The room is right off of a very busy street, and it was very loud (at all times).

Response from A:
I'm very disappointed to read this. But after being a host for four years I'm not surprised. This person was desperately looking for things to complain about. They even uninstalled my showerhead and complained about that! The claim of the bed being too small is ridiculous, it is a standard full-sized double bed. It's just sad to see how some people go through so much trouble to scam the system in order to get a cheaper stay, it's even sadder that it was done during the holidays. But either way, we will continue to provide our apartments and good service to people who want an affordable alternative to hotels in NYC.

Response from Robin:
Amalia's review is unfortunately not accurate as there is a supermarket called Extra 3 blocks away as well as a Dunken Donuts and McDonald's which serves coffee. There is another supermarket called Bravo also within walking distance. I am not sure why she would write this clearly misinformation. Amalia never mentioned anything about the noise. If there is an issue with cleanliness or noise please do say something so it can be addressed. We want everyone to have the best experience possible. Amalia wanted to use the kitchen which is fine but I don't expect to see it as part of the review private or public as its not listed as an amenity. In her private comments it was among her complaints. We use it as a place for storage etc..

Response from Feliz:
- The guests booked for private room for Airbnb (which the only option I have) but understood that sometime you guys might mistaken with “Entire apartment” everything was accurate. I stated in the listing that I will live / stay in the apartment - Toilets paper and stuff that guests need to use stocked up in the drawer in toilet which most guests could find it - access to lounge, I NEVER allow my guests to used and also mentioned in the listing that can’t be used.

Stayed with group of 2 others (total 3), we had plenty of space, and felt very safe. The building and apartment was clean and quiet. Location was convenient to Times Square and loads of restaurants including the one in the basement of the building. Really enjoyed my stay!

Response from LaTorre Fratelli:
Thanks for the feedback! I want to sincerely apologize you got a parking ticket. We do give our guests specific parking instructions and advice, which included to watch the street cleaning times if you park on the street. We do also suggest a parking garage less than a quarter mile away that charges about $10 a day. You can also reserve a spot in the lot online so you can come anytime. We never have issues finding street parking out front of the building though. The neighborhood is perfectly safe. It is definitely cultural diverse, but mostly consists of families and young professionals. We've been living in the area for years and never had any issues whatsoever. The walk to the path is wel lit and populated. The area is progressing rapidly and there are lots of new developments around the area due to the close proximity of the path. Thanks!

Great host, the only problem is the absence of a kitchen. Otherwise it is great.
Response from Leah:
Thank you but I am disappointed with the 2 stars for value and the overall 4 stars which is viewed as negative by Airbnb. During your stay, you paid $31 per night. Next time, please use the filters so that you find all of the great places in Brooklyn, NY with a kitchen plus the other amenities I offer including wifi, iron, self check-in, shampoo, hair dryer, near the 2 and 5 trains in a safe neighborhood with cable/HBO & Showtime at $31 in Brooklyn, NY. I found 2 such places (one in a bad neighborhood and the other far off in the boon docks of Brooklyn). I strongly suggest you use the filters to view other options so that you will be happy rather than giving poor ratings. I want my guests to be happy and know, with confidence, that they have found one of the most inexpensive places in Brooklyn because I work extremely hard to add value where possible since I do not offer a kitchen to my guests.

A few things to note: Usually I make sure to clean the bathroom regularly, but I had just returned from a business trip when Anastasia arrived (and there had been a previous guest staying), so I wasn't able to clean the bathroom until the next day. I will do better with that in the future. As far as street noise, I had recently installed the window air conditioner which does let in some additional noise (the window AC is not installed in the winter). That said, there have been several guests after Anastasia who have said the room is very quiet, so I suppose it just depends on perspective. In my experience living in a number of NYC apartments, it is much quieter than most, even with the AC in. Also, I believe the noise level could have had something to do with the window AC not being turned on because we ended up having cooler weather during Anastasia's stay. When the AC is on, noise from outside harder to hear. As far as communication goes, unfortunately due to how much I work, I sometimes have more or less time to show guests around. I have a thorough email that all guest receive before their arrival. I also want to note that there is a guide book in the bedroom that I have prepared with a lot of information about the apartment and the neighborhood. Towels are in the hallway closet (there is a sign on the closet door).

Response from Tiffany:
Please note that I do have a roommate. Always happy to accommodate an early arrival outside of my regular check-in time window (as I did here), but in such a case, my roommate will in fact be the one to open the door. If the idea of being checked in by someone who is not me does not sit well with you, please be sure to plan your arrival within the check-in window stated on the listing. As always, happy to accommodate an earlier arrival but as hosting is not my 24/7 job, I will not be readily available 24/7 to suit your arrival.

So the add never said we provided free parking and airbnb customer service explained this to you. You rented a sleeper sofa for 5 days in Jersey City and you wanted free parking come on a $100.00 dollar stay.

Response from Blair:
For $120-$150 a night - in NYC - honey please please please pay extra money and stay somewhere else. FUTURE RENTERS - Hello! Patricia had an reaction to a single cockroach in the summer, on a ground floor apt with a direct door to the outside - thus the Subjective review. Read on for further explanation. Otherwise, know that if you let me know that you are uncomfortable with something - I always handle it. See other reviews for proof. Case in point: the door was newly broken, Patricia failed to mention it to me until the review over a week later. I fixed it immediately bc that IS something that actually matters! And geez, don't you think, because it is a safety and liability thing for me in my personal home that you should have said something? FUTURE RENTERS - the ""mattress on the floor"" is the highest quality natural latex mattress set atop a platform that was designed specifically for that purpose - it is not a ""floor"" designed for any other use than sleeping. My cleaning gal did a full sweep of all the cabinets to check for opening and pest homes. She found nothing, which is on par with my experience for the last 5 years. Keep you space clean and you won't breed unwelcome visitors. BC it is ground floor you may get a passerby-er if you leave the doors open!

Lovely people and a clean, dry and cozy place. If you are searching for just a bed and don't mind a dormitory, take this one. 45 minutes from your door into Manhattan and tons of good Brooklyn bars, cafes and restaurants within 10 minutes walking. I would come again!

Nancy was kind and friendly, and provided everything I needed for my stay. Her breakfast each morning was generous and healthy, and the room was clean and small, but just as advertised, good value and quite sufficient for me. Would definitely recommend!

Nancy is a gem. I did not do my homework on the neighbourhood and it wasn't what I expected as far as eclectic cafes and lounges.

Nancy is a consummate host and an endlessly interesting person! I was in the middle of Spanish Harlem and enjoyed the opportunity to employ my embryonic Spanish. This is a real Harlem/New York experience!

Couldn't have asked for a better host. Nancy had a clean, organized room waiting for me with maps, outlines of the house rules to review, breakfast each day, and a warm demeanor to greet me with every day! Coming home everyday I felt like it was also my home.

Is as advertised - small bed in a room that sleeps 3. Host did not interact beyond the bare minimum.
Response from John:
If guest’s personality and attitude would have been more welcoming, host would have interacted more.

Great space, very welcoming hosts! Their travel tips helped me plan accordingly, they have a cute dog that is very sweet and loves to be pet. Definitely a great deal—cheap and accessible to the city.

I put in my request pretty late in the day as my booking in Jackson Heights didn't work out. But Doug accept it right. And what a nice room he had to offer. It was exactly as the picture. It was clean, comfortable and kinda artistic. It was perfectly for a 20 something visiting…Read more

This is the second time I've stayed at Doug's place, and the experience was a great as the first. Due to the nature of my trip, I was quite busy and spent most of my time out of the room — but that didn't affect the visit: Doug was as accommodating as ever. He's the best host you…Read more

Great size place for 1 person. But the place is lacking in amenities. There is no television, no extra towels. It’s a nice quiet large space for a one night stay for a person who only plans to sleep there. The bed was a decent size. The room was a bit chilly upon arriving but it…Read more

I really liked his place. The sheets and the bathroom were sparkling clean. I really cared about cleanliness when it comes to airbnb. Despite it being underground, it was a very nicely modeled room. Abundant of parking spots is always a big plus. There is no handsoap but shampoo…Read more
